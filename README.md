Description:
Mod that adds additional camo varients for the 'RT-1523G' type of radios. 

Content:
Camo Varients available for the backpacks 'RT-1523G (ASIP)' & 'RT-1523G (ASIP) Big' - 'CTRG Camo', 'CTRG Camo Green', 'MARPAT Woodland', 'MARPAT Desert', 'UCP', 'Black', 'M81', and 'Ranger Green'. Camos are designed around the use of the mod RHSUSAF.

History:
This mod was originally created by a request from my unit, which was disbanded, for one UCP varient for the 'RT-1523G (ASIP) Big'. 
Due to my unit having had disbanded, there was no longer use for my mod. So, I then decided to release the 'RT-1523G (ASIP) Big [UCP]' to the public for other units that will find better use of them, since TFR has a limited list of camo varients. I later created the a UCP varient for the 'RT-1523G (ASIP)' out of boredom to finally complete the list of 'RT-1523G' radio.
As time pasted, 2 users requested if I could make any additional varients of camo types, which can be found bellow in the comments. I then decided to created as requested with the exception of an asked 'Multicam' for now.
I plan to maybe further work on this mod for more varients of camo types depending on the feedback of the amount of users used my mod and how many users will ask.
